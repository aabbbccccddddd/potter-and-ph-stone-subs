 I should' ve known that you would be here, Professor McGonagall
 Good evening, Professor Dumbledore
 Are the rumors true, Albus?
 Im afraid so, professor.The good and the bad.
 And the boy?
 hagrid is bringing him
 is it wise to trust Hagrid with something so important?
 Professor, I would trust Hagrid with my life
 Professor Dumbledore,sir. Professor McGonagall
 No problems, i trust, Hagrid? 
 No, sir
 Little tyke fell asleep as we were flying over Bristol
 Try not to wake him
 There you go
 Do you really think it's safe, leaving him with these people?
 i've watched them all day. They're the worst sort of Muggles
 they really are..
 The only family he has
 He'll be famous. Every child in our world will know his name
 Exactly
 He's far better off growing up away all of that.
 Untill he's ready
 There, There, Hagrid.
 It's not really goodbye, after all
 Good luck
 Harry Potter
 Up. Get up!
 Now!
 Wake up, cousin! We're going to the zoo!
 Here he comes, the birthday boy. Happy birthday, son
 cook breakfast. And try not to burn anything.
 Yes, aunt Petunia
 I want everything to be perfect...
 For my Dudley's special day!
