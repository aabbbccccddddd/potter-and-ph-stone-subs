 I should' ve known that you would be here, Professor McGonagall
 Good evening, Professor Dumbledore
 Are the rumors true, Albus?
 Im afraid so, professor.The good and the bad.
 And the boy?
 hagrid is bringing him
 is it wise to trust Hagrid with something so important?
 Professor, I would trust Hagrid with my life
 Professor Dumbledore,sir. Professor McGonagall
 No problems, i trust, Hagrid? 
 No, sir
 Little tyke fell asleep as we were flying over Bristol
 Try not to wake him
 There you go
 Do you really think it's safe, leaving him with these people?
 i've watched them all day. They're the worst sort of Muggles
 they really are..
 The only family he has
 He'll be famous. Every child in our world will know his name
 Exactly
 He's far better off growing up away all of that.
 Untill he's ready
 There, There, Hagrid.
 It's not really goodbye, after all
 Good luck
 Harry Potter
 Up. Get up!
 Now!
 Wake up, cousin! We're going to the zoo!
 Here he comes, the birthday boy. Happy birthday, son
 cook breakfast. And try not to burn anything.
 Yes, aunt Petunia
 I want everything to be perfect...
 For my Dudley's special day!
 Hurry up! Bring my coffe, boy
 Yes, Uncle Vernon
 Aren't they wonderful, darling?
 How many are there? 
 36. Counted them myself
 36? But last year i had 37!
 But some are bigger than last year's 
 I don't care!
 This is what we're going to do
 we're going to buy you two new presents. How's that, pumpkin?
 It should be a lovely day at the zoo. I'm really looking forward to it.
 i'm warning you now, boy
 Any funny business, any at all...
 ... and you won't have any meals for a week
 Get in 
 Make it move
 Move!
 He's asleep!
 He's boring
 Sorry about him
 He doesn't understand what it's like, lying there
 watching people press their ugly faces in on you
 Can you hear me?
 It's just,I've never talked to a snake before.
 Do you?
 Do you talk to people often?
 You're from Burma, aren't you?
 Was it nice there?
 Do you miss your family?
 I see. That's me as well. I never knew my parents either.
 Mummy, Dad, you won't believe what this snake is doing!
 Thanks
 Anytime
 Snake!
 Mum! Mummy! Help me!
 My darling boy! How did you get in there?
 Who did this? How did you get in there? Is there a snake?
 It's all right, sweetheart. We'll get you out of these cold clothes
 What happened ? 
 I swear, I don't Know!
 The glass was there and then it was gone, like magic
 There's no such thing as magic
 Marge is ill. Ate a funny whelk
 Dad, Look! Harry's got a letter!
 It's mime!
 Yours? Who'd be writing to you?
 No more mail through this letterbox
 Have a lovely day at the office, dear
 Shoo! Go on
 Fine day, Sunday
 In my opinion, best day of the week. Why is that, Dudlye?
 Because there's no post on Sundays? 
 Right you are, Harry!
 No post on Sunday
 No blasted letters today! No, sir
 Not one single bloody letter. Not one!
 No, sir, not one blasted, miserable
 Make it stop, please
